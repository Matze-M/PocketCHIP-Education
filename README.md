# PocketCHIP-Education
Educational material involving PocketC.H.I.P..

## Intros

* Getting Started with PocketC.H.I.P.
* Getting Started with Pico-8

## Activities
In this directory you will find outlines and step-by-steps of short and long exercises. The shorter ones are particularly good for walk-up scenarios, for example at a Maker Faire or event where a table is set up. They can and should also be taught in the classroom and can be used with other exercises to create a longer lesson. The long exercises are geared towards a classroom or setting where there is a longer amount of time to explore and develop as a group.

## Reference 
Found in the Activities directory. These materials are good for printouts and supporting materials. For example, if teaching a workshop to a group that has never used Pico-8 before you may want to print out the Pico-8 cheatsheet document so students can quickly reference commands and controls. 

The LED components document is an companion to the Blink an LED from Pico-8 exercise and can be used on its own.
